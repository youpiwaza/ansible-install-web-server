### Generate or update a WordPress playbook
## builder_guy
# > ansible-playbook -i hostsWithCustomSSHPort 20-forge-a-wordpress.yml

# üí°How to use: Set variables in a dedicated file, and run this playbook to generate wordpress playbooks dedicated to one site
#   Run the newly created "start" playbook to generate, upload & deploy the .yml stack file.

# üìåYou can test this playbook by running it without modifications
# > ansible-playbook -i hostsWithCustomSSHPort 20-forge-a-wordpress.yml
# It will generate the example in
#     'ansible/generated/tests/masamune/test-wordpress--masamune--fr/'
#   sourced by the example var files
#     'roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-playbooks/vars/tests/masamune/test-wordpress--masamune--fr/test-wordpress--masamune--fr---vars.yml'

# üßæStep-by-step How to:
# 1. Duplicate 'ansible/roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-playbooks/vars/template.yml' to a proper location
#                                             Add '_secret' suffix to add this sensible file to .gitignore vv
#    like 'ansible/roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-playbooks/vars/TYPE/CLIENT/DASHED-URI/DASHED-URI---vars_secret.yml' (which will be üîß vars_file_path)
# 1.1. Edit your file according to your needs
#      Adjust project.vars_file_path  to reflect the path from step 1. See the üîß around line ~30
# 2. Edit this file '20-forge-a-wordpress.yml' to use your vars file,see the ‚úèÔ∏è around line ~48
# 3. Run/Test your playbook: ~> ansible-playbook -i hostsWithCustomSSHPort 20-forge-a-wordpress.yml
#    You can check the generated playbook file at the root/ or in the /generated folder
# 4. Make backup to a private github repository if everything runs smoothly, and save your file with the variables, and the generated/ folder

# You'll need the_builder_guy to have it's ssh key added to the local agent, cf. the_builder_guy generated documentation
