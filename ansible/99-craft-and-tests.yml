# Currently working on: Clean https management for treafik

# ---

# You'll need the_builder_guy to have it's ssh key added to the local agent, cf. the_builder_guy generated documentation
# You'll need the_docker_guy to have it's ssh key added to the local agent, cf. the_docker_guy generated documentation

# ---

### Roadmap
# - Proper https certificates for both main domains and subs
# - âœ… Proper redirection http to https
# - 

# For security reasons, the_docker_peon home folder is chown to root.
# the_docker_guy permissions problems : no rights in the_docker_peon folder
# Only the the_builder_guy can manage folders
