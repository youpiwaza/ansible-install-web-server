### Setup sftp user
##    Notes: https://github.com/youpiwaza/server-related-tutorials/tree/master/04-user-restrict-and-sftp
# - Create dedicated user
#   - Use role or wtv but needs auth keyz
#   - name : CLIENT---DASHED-URI
#   - Create chroot folder, with proper location/rights/own + move .ssh/ & .cache/ + README.md
#   - Remove original home folder
#   - usermod: group, shell nologin, new home folder
#   - 
#   - Create home/my-stuff folder, with proper location/rights/own + keep .ssh/ & .cache/ + README.md
#   - Generate user README.md ansible-install-web-server\ansible\roles\users\templates\ssh-users-manual-commands.md.j2
