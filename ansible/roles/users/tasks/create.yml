### Create user
# https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/user_module.html
- name: 'Create a new user {{ item.name }}'
  user:
    name: '{{ item.name }}'
    # BE CAREFUL, if the terminal isn't installed, it prevents users from ssh login !
    # zsh will be set as default shell after it's installation
    shell: /bin/bash
  when: users is defined

## Prevent overriding of zsh terminal (later in the setup) for bash
## LATER: ♻️Refacto > Gather package facts only one time
# It occurs if this the task:
#   2-generate-users-and-change-ssh-port.yml
# is called again, without calling:
#   3-utils-security-docker-setup.yml
# afterwards. So here's the fix

## Get facts to know if zsh is already installed
#     https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_facts_module.html
- name: Gather the package facts
  package_facts:
    manager: auto

## If zsh is installed, use it as terminal
- name: 'Change default terminal to zsh for {{ item.name }}'
  user:
    name: '{{ item.name }}'
    shell: /usr/bin/zsh
  when: "'zsh' in ansible_facts.packages"
