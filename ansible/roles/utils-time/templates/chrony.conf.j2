# Welcome to the chrony configuration file. See chrony.conf(5) for more
# information about usuable directives.

# acquisitionport 1123
# port 123

# This will use (up to):
# - 4 sources from ntp.ubuntu.com which some are ipv6 enabled
# - 2 sources from 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org which are ipv6 enabled as well
# - 1 source from [01].ubuntu.pool.ntp.org each (ipv4 only atm)
# This means by default, up to 6 dual-stack and up to 2 additionnal IPv4-only
# sources will be used.
# At the same time it retains some protection against one of the entries being
# down (compare to just using one of the lines). See (LP: #1754358) for the
# discussion.
#
# About using servers from the NTP Pool Project in general see (LP: #104525).
# Approved by Ubuntu Technical Board on 2011-02-08.
# See http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html for more information.

# This directive tells 'chronyd' to parse the 'adjtime' file to find out if the
# real-time clock keeps local time or UTC. It overrides the 'rtconutc' directive.

hwclockfile /etc/adjtime

# This directive enables kernel synchronisation (every 11 minutes) of the
# real-time clock. Note that it canâ€™t be used along with the 'rtcfile' directive.

# Step the system clock instead of slewing it if the adjustement is larger than
# one second, but only if the first three clock updates
