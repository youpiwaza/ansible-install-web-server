### Generate a WordPress role
## builder_guy
# > ansible-playbook -i hostsWithCustomSSHPort 20-forge-a-wordpress-role.yml

# üí°How to use: Set variables in a dedicated file, and run this playbook to generate a wordpress role dedicated to one site
#   Run the newly created role to generate, upload & deploy the .yml stack file.

# üìåYou can test this playbook by running it without modifications
# > ansible-playbook -i hostsWithCustomSSHPort 20-forge-a-wordpress-role.yml
# It will generate the example
#     'ansible/200-forge---test-wordpress--masamune--fr---wordpress-stack.yml'
#   sourced by the example var files
#     'roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-role/vars/tests/masamune/test-wordpress--masamune--fr/test-wordpress--masamune--fr---vars.yml'

# üßæStep-by-step How to:
# 1. Duplicate 'ansible/roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-role/vars/template.yml' to a proper location
#                                             Add '_secret' suffix to add this sensible file to .gitignore vv
#    like 'ansible/roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-role/vars/TYPE/CLIENT/DASHED-URI/DASHED-URI---vars_secret.yml' (which will be üîß vars_file_path)
# 1.1. Edit your file according to your needs
#      Adjust project.vars_file_path  to reflect the path from step 1. See the üîß around line ~30
# 2. Edit '20-forge-a-wordpress-role.yml' to use your vars file,see the ‚úèÔ∏è around line ~48
# 3. Run/Test your playbook: ~> ansible-playbook -i hostsWithCustomSSHPort 20-forge-a-wordpress-role.yml
#    You can check the generated role file at the root folder 20X-forge---DASHED-URI---wordpress-stack-generated.yml
# 4. Make backup to a private github repository if everything runs smoothly
# 4.1 Private github account, ansible/roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-role/vars/TYPE/CLIENT/DASHED-URI/DASHED-URI---vars_secret.yml
# 4.2 History / ansible/roles/stack-web-wordpress--generate-role/vars/TYPE/CLIENT/DASHED-URI/DASHED-URI---vars-{{ currentDateTime }}.yml
# 4.3 Add 20X-forge---DASHED-URI---wordpress-stack-generated.yml
# 4.4 History / 20X-forge---DASHED-URI---wordpress-stack-generated-{{ currentDateTime }}.yml

# You'll need the_builder_guy to have it's ssh key added to the local agent, cf. the_builder_guy generated documentation
